        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Reports have surfaced from the mountain village of Ashgrave regarding mysterious and unsettling phenomena. Initial claims describe 
            missing persons, cracked religious statues, and erratic behavior among the villagers. Local officials, including Mayor Edrick Vael, 
            are unaccounted for. Multiple search parties sent to investigate have either failed to return or provided nonsensical reports.
        </p>   
        
        <p>Accounts suggest something far beyond comprehension may be at work. Unexplained mutations, strange lights, and whispers heard in the darkness 
            point to a possible connection to celestial or aberrant forces. With no concrete understanding of the source, an investigation team is assembling to uncover the truth behind Ashgrave’s plight.

      <h3>Final Observations:</h3>
      <p>Upon arrival, the villagers seems to be weirdly calm in contrast to what the reports stated. They were stated to have met a bloodhunter named Sol who happened to be investigating the area.
         It was also stated that after encounter with the entity named, "The Beast", the villagers have then morphed into erratic and mutated aberrations.
         After the following incident regarding the former mobile task force E, all operations will be terminated. There was only one survivor of the task force sent
         and they brought back with them a highly anomalous dog that contains wild magic.
