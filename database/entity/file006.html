        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The Beast, refered by the locals as Ulthrash or simply the beast, is a gigantic bone-like deer anomaly discovered on the mountains
            of AshGrave. Its presence seems to induce a mutagenic like evolutions on entities up to 100 kilometers away. 
            Visual and Auditory phenomena reported by research personnel include whispers in an unknown language. Researches were only able to make out
            one word, "Prepare"
        </p>

        <p>Exposure to presence emitted by the Ulthrash has resulted in psychological deterioration and agressiveness, and in later cases, 
            vbody mutations such as tentacles and increased muscle mass.
